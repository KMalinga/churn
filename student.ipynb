    "SyriaTel, a company in the telecommunication industry, has approached us with a pressing challenge: high customer churn rates are leading to financial losses and decreased customer satisfaction. To combat this issue, SyriaTel aims to accurately predict which customers are likely to leave, allowing them to take proactive measures to retain them. However, traditional methods for predicting customer churn have proven to be unreliable, with high rates of false positives and false negatives.\n",

    "In light of this, SyriaTel has tasked us with developing a machine learning classification model that can accurately predict customer churn based on historical usage patterns and demographic information. Our goal is to create a model that will help SyriaTel minimize financial losses and improve customer satisfaction."
